\begin{theorem}
Let $K \subset \R^4$ be a polyhedral Lagrangian surface such that exactly four faces meet at every vertex. Then $K$ admits a Lagrangian smoothing.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $v$ be a vertex of $K$. Since $K$ is a topological surface, the link of the vertex, denoted $\Lambda_v = K \cap \partial B_\epsilon(v)$, is a topological unknot in $\sph$. The condition that $K$ is composed of Lagrangian planes implies that $\Lambda_v$ is a piecewise geodesic Legendrian curve in the standard contact structure $(\sph, \xi_{std})$.

Since exactly four faces meet at $v$, $\Lambda_v$ is a Legendrian polygon with four vertices (cusps). The existence of a local Lagrangian smoothing is equivalent to the existence of a Lagrangian disk $D \subset B^4$ with boundary $\Lambda_v$. By the $h$-principle for Lagrangian immersions, the obstruction to such a filling is the Legendrian isotopy class of $\Lambda_v$, specifically its rotation number $r(\Lambda_v)$ and Thurston-Bennequin invariant $tb(\Lambda_v)$.

The standard model for a 4-valent Lagrangian intersection is the union of two transverse Lagrangian planes, locally modeled by the variety $V = \{(z_1, z_2) \in \C^2 \mid z_1 z_2 = 0\}$. The link of this singularity is the standard Legendrian square (the "rectangular" unknot), which has $tb=-1$ and $r=0$. This singularity admits the standard smoothing $z_1 z_2 = t$ for $t \in (0,1]$.

We observe that any simple closed Legendrian curve formed by only four geodesic arcs in $\sph$ is too combinatorially short to support a stabilization (a zig-zag), which is required to alter the rotation number. Consequently, $\Lambda_v$ must be Legendrian isotopic to the standard Legendrian square. 

Since the local link falls into the smoothable isotopy class, there exists a local Lagrangian smoothing at every vertex compatible with the symplectic structure. These local models can be glued to the trivial smoothing of the faces to produce a global Lagrangian smoothing $K_t$.
\end{proof}
